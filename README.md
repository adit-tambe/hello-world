# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I'm a first-year Computer Science student, currently focused on building a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving. I'm learning C++ and Python, and exploring data structures, algorithms, and basic projects to put theory into practice. This repository marks the start of my coding journey â€” a place where I'll share small but meaningful projects, practice exercises, and ideas as I grow. I'm not an expert yet, but I'm consistent, curious, and committed to improving every day.
